## The whole editing world

Ah...the world of editing code. There are so many out there. So many to choose from. So many to stick with...which is what I struggled with. It's a really tough world out there or if you are simple person, its an easy world. In my case, it's sometimes hell. 

Now as a programmer, I always  choose different editors. Let me grow through a list of editors and my experience with them. At the end of the section, I will list  my rating for it. NOW before I  continue, this is MY opinion built  off of MY experiences. So please take this with a grain of salt...or pepper...or some adobo. 

###1. Notepad++

![Notepad++](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Notepad%2B%2B_Logo.png)

This was my first editor and one that still lingers in my heart. During my  college years, this was my editor to go  with when developing sites or even doing the most simple editing of source code. Its really simple, does suntax highlighting for most languages out there, has themes available (which I should have done while using it), and you can use plugins. Easy to use and gets the work done.

They have a bunch of [features](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/features/) available but you can take a look for yourself.

###2. Atom

The Atom editor...The glorius RAM eater, slow starting, but yet beautiful editor. How I loved thee...Oh sorry. As I was saying, the Atom editor was my second editor of choice. I picked up this beauty when I heard Github had made it's own text editor. I was like "I have to try it". I did. It was amazing at first. The UI was cool, plugins were amazing (and written in Javascript!), and  my editing had improved by learning some simple commands and/or keystrokes. 

![atom-colo-edit](https://www.fossmint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Atom-Text-Editor-for-Linux.png)

I'm telling you, I was in love...(until I met my future wife). I used this bad  boy for about 1.5 years. The plugins were the best part though. There was literally a plugin for everything I could think of. Don't get me started  on the themes available. I was always switching my theme. Always. I think I was using a new theme each week then after I went through  the list  of installed themes, I circled back. But then one day, it hit me. The very slow startups, the amount of RAM it was eating, and the amount of processing power being  consumed. Everything was  starting to slow down. Mind you, at the time, my current laptop didn't have the best specs (15.6 in screen, 1366x768 resolution, 4GB RAM, Intel Celeron processor, and Intel HD Graphics). But Atom did it's work.

Now I know there are improvements that have been made to the editor regarding speed and performance so don't take this critique to heart. I don't mean to bash it so much. Atom is a good text editor. I have gone back to it every now  and then to see the improvements then use it for a little test drive but I have moved away from it for sure. I suggest you check it out your self.

###3. Visual Studio Code

![vs-code-icon](https://blog.launchdarkly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/visualstudio_code-card.png)

This is one good editor that I enjoyed using. Similar  to Atom, it was a little of a fiesty editor when it came to RAM and Processing but  over time, I experienced the changes and  felt that it wasn't as bad as Atoms. Microsoft worked their butt off with this  one and made a really decent code editor. Even with a built in Terminal Emulator! It was awesome. I didn't even have to switch to my terminal then right back to my editor. Everything  was in one place! (Atom of course can do the same but needed a  plugin to run a  terminal emulator). Now with VSCode, you didn't need to install certain language intellisense cause VSCode supported most languages out the box like Javascript and Typescript (of course Typescript. It  is their own language). Intellisense really changed the game for me. I would just type away and  VSCode would just show me what I am aiming for and show me how to use it. Gave me definitions, syntax usage, and a little example. Atom has something  similar to Intellisense but requires  the use of a language server like TernJS. A little slower than Intellisense but it got the work done.

My time using it was fun and I loved the plugins and themes. So many cool themes. But for some reason, I still felt a little slow. Now at  this time, it wasn't my machine (I had just got my gaming laptop so specs were up there) but the GUI itself. Startup still felt slow (especially when executing from my terminal) and the file explorer was always ugly to me (although you can now tweak it to have nicer icons). Overall, coding in this puppy felt good. Now most starting developers use VSCode or Atom. Most likely VSCode than Atom but that's another argument. 

####Rating: 8.7/10

###4. Vim

![vim-logo](https://miro.medium.com/max/512/1*X5dVOQB4nDpsLH4KSbMiIg.png)

Uhhhhhh...well...I tried but  I couldn't quit so I gave up. Don't look at me like that. I was young and stupid. Anyways...moving on.

###5. Emacs

Now  before  all the Vim users start to throw chairs at me, allow me to explain. After using VSCode for a while, I figured it was time to beef up my editing skills. I gave up oh so quickly on Vim so I needed another terminal editor. I didn't look into Emacs UNTIL I saw the move "The Internship" with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson when they were discussing why use Emacs over Vim and I was like "huh? Never heard of it". That's when I looked  into it and Saw that it was under GNU. So I tried it out but...I couldn't see it's full potential because I need to use certain key combinations to use it's powers. Man, I felt like I was doing Dance Dance Revolution on my keyboard with my fingers. So I looked into alternatives to make Emacs usage a little easier for a very beginner like me. They were called Distributions. And here I thought only Linux had Distros. 

####A. Doom Emacs

![doom-emacs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/screenshots/main.png)

Doom Emacs had the Cacodemon from Doom as their mascot and I absolutely love Doom (Before the 2016 version. Like old school Doom...even though I am not  that old.). So I thought, why not give it a shot. I followed the steps to set it up (which was quick and painless. Just needed Emacs installed) and I was in business. Every plugin was installed for me and I was good to go. This was  the time I was introduced into Modal Editing (which vim does). Now Emacs is NOT like Vim and Vim is NOT like Emacs but someone made a plugin called Evil Mode that allows you to perform Vim commands in Emacs to use Emacs' powers. Again, I gave up quickly on Vim but decided to give this a shot (Mind you for my projects, I still had to use VSCode until I was comfortable). Overall, it wasn't half bad. Yeah, I messed up here and there by accidentally performing the wrong keystrokes but all in all...it was worth it. 

I was learning my way through this but I still wasn't that comfortable and after a while, I kinda got annoyed. So I gave up and went crying  to VSCode. Now I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying that there is a learning curve and it takes time to get adjusted but I was very impatient so I gave up. It is a really dope Distro though and I did go back to it when  I had the patience. Like coding was fine and fast, I still had to setup some language servers and add the syntax highlighting plugins, and bless Org Mode. By far, one of the greatest modes I ever used. I suggest you try it out and fight with hell hahahahaha!!!! I don't mean literal hell...it was a Doom reference cause the Cacodemon...never mind. Moving on!

####Rating: 8.5/10

####B. Spacemacs

![spacemacs-editor](https://ucarecdn.com/168277bb-c73b-4ef3-a312-f1430302dc12/)

Now this distro...oh this distro, I have to say is one of my all time favorites. After the fail with Doom Emacs and going back to VSCode, I had  taken about a month before I started to look at other editors again. I was scared and didn't want to leave  my safe nest of VSCode but avast, I decided to venture  out again and get my feet  wet. I was going to try Vim again until I looked more into Evil mode. While looking more into it, I found Spacemacs. Spacemacs  is another distro for Emacs based on Evil mode. As it says on their site, "The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs and Vim!". Gosh darnit! They were right! I had the ability to either use the Vim mode, Emacs mode, or Hybrid  mode (which is using both Vim and Emacs at  the same time). 

This was a whole lot smoother compared to Doom Emacs. The menu was  much easier to memorize (Doom Emacs had a menu too) and it felt oh so smoother. The Leader Key (or main key to start a command) was the space bar (hehe...see  what they did there?). So every command I executed  on the keyboard was by using the space then 1 or 2 other keyboard strokes. For instance Space-p-p helped me open a project or Space-b-n moved me to the next buffer and so forth. Programming in this puppy was amazing. No intellisense but it still worked faster and smoother than the other editors. Believe me. It just took a while to configure but hey, all worth it. Now I used Spacemacs mostly in the terminal when I should have been using the GUI but I was trying to move away from the GUI. I was tired of it. So Spacemacs came to play. After a while, I switched to Spacemacs and made it my primary editor. To be honest, I did use the GUI sometimes but I still prefered the Terminal. 

####Rating: 9.2/10

Now the Emacs distros are not  all bad and I am pretty sure there are more. Overall, I prefered these two and liked them (especially Spacemacs). But we are not done yet. We still have one more to go. 

###6. Neovim/Vim

![neovim-logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Neovim-logo.svg/742px-Neovim-logo.svg.png)

Ladies and Gentleman, we  are back at it again with Vim...or should I say Neovim. Yes, there are 2 versions...well 3. There is Vi, Vim, and Neovim. The editor I decided to use was Neovim. Why? To be honest, I don't know. I was just going through reddit and came along this piece of software. I have to say, I like it. Any differences? well not much. The biggest difference I can tell you is that Neovim was rewritten and compiled using Lua. It still uses Vimscript and fully compatiable with  most Vim plugins out there. Also according to Neovim's site, Neovim was built using 30%  less source code. In case anyone is wondering, Yes, Neovim is a fork of Vim. 

After taking time to learn Neovim and it's functionality (Thank you Spacemacs for being my training wheels), I grew to love this Editor. It's  really light weight, I don't have much plugins used on here, and the key combos are now just muscle memory (as well as the commands to use). 

The whole modal editing process just makes everything make more sense. For instance, when my hand is just on the keyboard but nothing wants to come  out, my fingers have a bad habit of just hitting the keyboard. Now I don't mean like going full spasm on the keyboard, I just mean hitting a random key once in a while. In an ordinary editor (e.g. VSCode), the key would be hit and typed into my editor. I would have to delete it and go back to my thought process until my hands do it again. With Neovim, this problem  was resolved for me. Now you maybe looking at me wait...Spacemacs kind of solved this problem. They have modal editing  as well. Yes  they do but Spacemacs felt  a little big for me. Even the startup times were sometimes a little slow and the amount of plugins that were installed by DEFAULT were kind of unnecessary. Neovim is just lightweight and gets the job done for me. 

Here are the great gigs about Neovim/Vim, I found Intellisense! Oh yes, I found a plugin that does Intellisense for Neovim and it's amazing. So VSCode can go somewhere! (No I'm kidding, VSCode is a cool editor and worth looking at). Anyways, Neovim has been awesome for me. Even my setup is lightweight and I can take it anywhere with me. Even on my phone. Right now to make  this post, I'm using my phone with Neovim. Take that GUI Editors!

Oh did I mention I ditched the GUI in favor of the terminal? Oh yeah, I did. I would advise everyone do the same. The minimalistic lifestyle  is lit guys.

###The End?
Now that we have reached  the end, there are a couple of things I want you take away from this post:

- This  is from MY EXPERIENCE, so don't judge the editor by what I said. Take a crack at it and then come back and fight me on why I am wrong. There is a war out  there about Vim vs Emacs so be careful and tread lightly. 
- This is MY OPINION. Again, take a crack at it before knocking it. It turns out that you would prefer Atom over VSCode or you might hail Notepad++ as the king of editors. I don't  know but its up to you. 
- Think of your Editor as your partner. It takes a while before you can find your perfect partner to work side by side with and get things done. 
- Last but not least, have fun. Trying to find that perfect editor is  like an adventure. The journey starts, you go off to different lands, and when you think you found the one, did you really find the one? Is it...The end?


Have fun guys and remember, when programming, Program it Forward.
